HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION:
1. Open the application using the link available in the about section in the repository name "sharpe-app".
2. To make a transaction, click on the anchor element name "Transaction" in the Home Page in the navigation bar, you will be redirected to a new page.
3. In the new page, a form is available to make the necessary transaction.
4. Only once the necessary details are entered, the "submit" button is activated, click on the submit button to perform the transaction.
5. Once clicked, then click on the anchor element named "Data" in the navigation bar to check the deatils of previously performed transaction/trasactions.

CHALLENGES FACED:
1. It was slighly challenging to validate the address format of the wallet as it was asked in "ethereum" format.
2. It was challenging to store and fetch data from the cloud firestore because this is the first time I have worked with firebase.
